href=\"https://www1.udel.edu/registrar/faculty_staff/subjects.html\" \n                target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Academic Advisor</a> who \n                is meant to help guide the student to graduation.</p>\n            <p>The advisor's role is to help students become self-sufficient, and they aren't intended to make\n                 decisions on behalf students. Ideally, by the end of their degree, \n                 students have chosen their own path to graduation, with minimal input from their adviser. \n                 To facilitate their choices, students are often strongly recommended to construct a Degree Plan.</p>\n            <p>However, an open-ended field like <a href=\"https://catalog.udel.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=47&poid=34727&returnto=8860\" \n                target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Computer Science</a> poses a unique challenge, since there are many \n                possible paths to graduation with different <a href=\"https://catalog.udel.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=47&ent_oid=5200\" \n                target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">tradeoffs and opportunities</a>. Indeed, many students come\n                 in with almost no knowledge of the possible career directions and what courses support \n                 those paths. Further, the incredibly high student-to-faculty ratio, along with already stretched\n                  faculty resources, exacerbates the situation. There is never enough time for busy faculty to meet\n                   with their advisees.</p>\n            <p>Although there are many logistical and administrative barriers to success, at\n                 least one procedural problem might be solvable with technology: many students struggle to \n                 put together a clear 4-year plan without a lot of prompting and help from their adviser.</p>\n            <p>Our goal, with this website, is to help Computer Science majors at the University of Delaware to put \n                together a Degree Plan and streamline their advising
